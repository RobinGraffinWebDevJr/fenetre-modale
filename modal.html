<p>Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>
<p>Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? What are their names? <strong> You lived before you met me?!</strong> <em> Well, then good news!</em> It's a suppository.</p>
<h2>Pansy.</h2>
<p>I wish! It's a nickel. Bite my shiny metal ass. We're also Santa Claus! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!</p>
<ol>
<li>Can we have Bender Burgers again?</li><li>We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.</li><li>Guess again.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Who are you, my warranty?!</h3>
<p>Why would a robot need to drink? I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. No, I'm Santa Claus!</p>

<li>OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.</li><li>Guess again.</li><li>I never loved you.</li>

<p>I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Meh. You wouldn't. Ask anyway!</p>
<p>Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.</p>
<p>There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. File not found. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p>
<p>Oh right. I forgot about the battle. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! We don't have a brig. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p>
<p>You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Soon enough. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Say it in Russian! I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.</p>
<p>The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Yeah, lots of people did. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.</p>
<p>We don't have a brig. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.</p>
<p>And until then, I can never die? Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! File not found. And until then, I can never die? Bender, you risked your life to save me!</p>
<p>Can I use the gun? Now what? Large bet on myself in round one. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".</p>
<p>And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Meh. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Bender, quit destroying the universe! No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!</p>
<p>No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.</p>
